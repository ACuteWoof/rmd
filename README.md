# A simple markdown reader

This site lets you read markdown files directly from the web since web browsers apparently don't render markdown.

To read a markdown file, https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ACuteWoof/rmd/refs/heads/main/README.md (the file you're reading right now) for example, put the URL of the file with the `url` search param.

For this example, the URL for the reader would be: [`http://localhost:3000/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ACuteWoof/rmd/refs/heads/main/README.md`](http://localhost:3000/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ACuteWoof/rmd/refs/heads/main/README.md)
